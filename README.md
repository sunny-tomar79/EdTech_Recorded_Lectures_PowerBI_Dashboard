# EdTec# 🎓 EdTech Recorded Lectures Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📘 Project Overview  
This Power BI dashboard analyzes recorded-lecture data collected from multiple EdTech sources to surface actionable insights for an EdTech startup.  
Focus: **category-wise** analysis to guide which course types and languages to prioritise, discover top instructors, and measure engagement patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Distribution of course types by **category** and **sub-category** (count of courses).  
2. Average number of **views** per category, sub-category, and language.  
3. Top and most commonly taught **skills** by category.  
4. Distribution of **course languages**.  
5. Language preferences per category (top 5 categories by user preference).  
6. Relationship between **subtitles** availability and views.  
7. Top **3 instructors** per category/subcategory by ratings (static view).  
8. Relationship between **course duration** and views (special rule: monthly content = 60 hrs; flexible = 200 hrs).  
9. Impact of **skill variety** within each category on viewership.

## 🚫 Data Privacy
The dataset used is proprietary to the client / collected from public EdTech sites; **raw data is not uploaded** in this repository. Analysis shown is for demonstration and decision-making purposes only.

---

## 📊 Key Insights (example / expected)
- Categories such as **Data Science** and **Business** show highest views and skill diversity.  
- Courses with **subtitles** tend to have higher average views (accessibility increases reach).  
- Top instructors (by rating) can be targeted for content partnerships.  
- Language preference mapping helps localise content for the top 5 categories.  
*(Actual numbers and visuals are available in the PBIX and presentation.)*

## ⚙️ Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI Desktop** — data modelling, DAX measures, visuals, slicers.  
- **Excel / CSV** — cleaning & transformations prior to import into Power BI.  
- Visuals used: KPI cards, bar charts, stacked bars, treemaps, slicers, tables, scatter plots (duration vs views).
