## 📘 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a data analysis task for an **EdTech startup** aiming to expand its offerings in recorded lectures.  
The goal was to analyze course data from multiple platforms and design an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that provides meaningful insights into course trends, engagement, and viewer behavior.

2. Calculating **average views** by category, subcategory, and language to identify engagement trends.  
3. Identifying the **most in-demand skills** across various categories.  
4. Exploring **language preferences** and **subtitle impacts** on viewership.  
5. Highlighting the **top instructors** for each category based on ratings.  
6. Studying the **relationship between course duration and number of views**.  
7. Understanding how **variety of skills** influences viewership patterns.
